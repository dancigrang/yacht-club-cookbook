* 10 eggs
* 3 limes

Chorizo:
1. Put 1-2 tbsp olive oil in a pan on medium high heat. 

2. Break open chorizo from casing, put in pan. Break up chorizo with wooden spoon into small pieces. 

3. Sauté for 7-8 mins until it reaches over 160 degrees per package instructions, and starts to brown and crisp just a bit near edges. 

4. Add kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste (should probably be fine on its own though). 

5. Take off heat and set aside in a bowl.

Beans:
1. Oil a pan on medium heat. 

2. Open can and rinse beans in colander. Shake off excess moisture. 

3. Add beans to pan and begin to sauté. 

4. Finely mince 1 clove of garlic and add to pan. 

5. Take one lime and add zest of entire lime to beans. Cut in half and add juice from 1/2 of the lime.

6. Sauté 5-7 minutes total. Set aside in another bowl.

Peppers/onion:
1. Add tbsp of olive oil to pan on medium heat. 

2. Dice one red bell pepper into 1/4 - 1/2 inch pieces.

3. Add to pan with pinch of kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper.

4. Sauté 4-5 minutes until starts to soften.

5. Dice 1/2 of a large Spanish onion. Add to pan. 

6. Add a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. 

7. Sauté 4-5 minutes until they start to become translucent. 

8. Add 1/2 of a 4 oz can of diced green chilis. 

9. Sauté an additional 3-4 mins until fragrant. 

10. Remove from heat and set aside.

Eggs:
1. Oil pan. Scramble 10 large eggs in a bowl. Add appropriate salt and pepper. Add eggs to pan and cook until light and fluffy, Stir almost constantly to ensure even cooking and a light, airy texture.

2. Combine all ingredients in a large container and stir to mix and combine. 

3. Refrigerate in an airtight container up to 5-6 days,but I suspect they won’t last that long given how awesome they are.

To serve:
 * Crisp tortillas in pan with a small amount of oil. Microwave mixture until proper temp for serving. Add to tortillas. Garnish with fresh avocado or guacamole salsa, a few cilantro leaves, and a lime wedge. Add cheese if you wish.
