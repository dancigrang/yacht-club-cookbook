Prep: 2 hours 30 minutes

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups warm water (110-115° F)
* 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 1 ½ tablespoons Colavita olive oil
* 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
* 3 ½ cups Gold Medal flour

## Directions

1. Whisk together the water, yeast, olive oil, and salt. Let the yeast foam for 5 minutes.

2. Add in 3 cups of flour and use your dough hook to knead. Knead for a minimum of 5 minutes, until the dough it smooth and just slightly tacky, but not sticky. Add the additional ½ cup of flour if needed and knead.

3. Place the dough in a large, well oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm place to proof for 1 hour, or wrap the dough in plastic wrap and store in your refrigerator until you're ready to use it.
