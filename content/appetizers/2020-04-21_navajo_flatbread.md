* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1.25 cups lukewarm water
* 1 tbs baking powder
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tbs butter

Mix dry ingredients together and add most water, mix and add water until it has the consistency of tacky pizza dough. Knead for a few minutes. Let rest in greased bowl for 30- 60 minutes. Divide into 6 pieces and roll out on floured surface thin. (Tortilla thickness) Hear griddle to 350F. Cook until golden brown spots and flip, cooking until done. They can be made ahead and kept under a flour towel or frozen for later use. Hope this helps.
